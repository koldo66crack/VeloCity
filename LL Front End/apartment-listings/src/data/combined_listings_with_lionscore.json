    "description": "Spanning an incredible layout with stunning park views, Residence 4A at 99 Morningside Avenue is a beautifully designed three-bedroom home that balances space, light, and privacy. The moment you step inside, the elevated great room immediately impresses  with its expansive proportions, framed by two oversized south-facing windows that flood the space with natural light.\nThe king-sized primary suite is a true retreat, featuring a spacious walk-in closet for effortless organization. The two additional bedrooms, set apart on the north side of the home, provide privacy and separation from the main living area.\nDesigned with both style and function in mind, the separate kitchen is outfitted with custom Italian oak cabinetry, frosted glass upper cabinets, and a refined combination of White Macaubas quartzite and polished white quartz countertops and backsplash.  A suite of Bosch appliances, including a custom-paneled refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher, as well as a gas range and microwave, complete the space.\nBoth bathrooms exude a sophisticated elegance. The primary bath is a luxurious escape with White Carrara marble floors and walls accented by sleek black glass tile, while the secondary bath features ash-gray porcelain tile floors and classic white subway  tile walls. Fixtures by Duravit and Moen add a polished touch.\nPerfectly positioned across from Morningside Park in the heart of Harlem, 99 Morningside offers twenty-three thoughtfully designed condominium residences, all enhanced by floor-to-ceiling windows, a refined natural palette, and the benefits of a 15-year  421a tax abatement. Residents enjoy an attended lobby, a high-performance fitness center, bike storage, and a furnished sun deck.\nSet on a picturesque tree-lined block in South Harlem, this prime location is moments from express subway access and the vibrant energy of Frederick Douglass Boulevard.\nAt the time of lease signing, the tenant is responsible for paying one month's rent to the landlord as the first month's payment, along with a refundable security deposit equal to one month's rent, also payable to the landlord and held as security for performance  of the lease obligations. In addition, a non-refundable $400 lease application fee is payable to the management company. The building also requires a refundable $500 move-in deposit and a separate refundable $500 move-out deposit, both payable to the building.  Additionally, the broker or agent facilitating the lease may charge the tenant up to $20 for the cost of conducting their own background or credit check.",
