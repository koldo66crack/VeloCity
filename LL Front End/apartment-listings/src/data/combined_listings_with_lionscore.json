    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",

    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",

    "description": "Morningside Heights is home to several higher learning institutions, including Columbia University and Barnard College, and is flourishing with leafy, natural beauty. The neighborhood is balanced between the loveliness of Morningside and Riverside Parks, the former of which contains something you’d never expect to find in this city — a cliff. Atop that outcropping of Manhattan schist sits the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a structure as striking in its design as in its sheer size. Though you’ll find a collection of sparkling condominiums, much of Morningside Heights falls within a historic district that preserves the area’s look from around the turn of the 20th century, when it initially became a residential haven. Those homes primarily consist of Colonial and Georgian Revival rowhouses and apartment buildings with distinctive features, like the curved facades of The Colosseum and The Paterno.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Morningside Heights is home to several higher learning institutions, including Columbia University and Barnard College, and is flourishing with leafy, natural beauty. The neighborhood is balanced between the loveliness of Morningside and Riverside Parks, the former of which contains something you’d never expect to find in this city — a cliff. Atop that outcropping of Manhattan schist sits the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a structure as striking in its design as in its sheer size. Though you’ll find a collection of sparkling condominiums, much of Morningside Heights falls within a historic district that preserves the area’s look from around the turn of the 20th century, when it initially became a residential haven. Those homes primarily consist of Colonial and Georgian Revival rowhouses and apartment buildings with distinctive features, like the curved facades of The Colosseum and The Paterno.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Morningside Heights is home to several higher learning institutions, including Columbia University and Barnard College, and is flourishing with leafy, natural beauty. The neighborhood is balanced between the loveliness of Morningside and Riverside Parks, the former of which contains something you’d never expect to find in this city — a cliff. Atop that outcropping of Manhattan schist sits the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a structure as striking in its design as in its sheer size. Though you’ll find a collection of sparkling condominiums, much of Morningside Heights falls within a historic district that preserves the area’s look from around the turn of the 20th century, when it initially became a residential haven. Those homes primarily consist of Colonial and Georgian Revival rowhouses and apartment buildings with distinctive features, like the curved facades of The Colosseum and The Paterno.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Spanning an incredible layout with stunning park views, Residence 4A at 99 Morningside Avenue is a beautifully designed three-bedroom home that balances space, light, and privacy. The moment you step inside, the elevated great room immediately impresses  with its expansive proportions, framed by two oversized south-facing windows that flood the space with natural light.\n\nThe king-sized primary suite is a true retreat, featuring a spacious walk-in closet for effortless organization. The two additional bedrooms, set apart on the north side of the home, provide privacy and separation from the main living area.\n\nDesigned with both style and function in mind, the separate kitchen is outfitted with custom Italian oak cabinetry, frosted glass upper cabinets, and a refined combination of White Macaubas quartzite and polished white quartz countertops and backsplash.  A suite of Bosch appliances, including a custom-paneled refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher, as well as a gas range and microwave, complete the space.\n\nBoth bathrooms exude a sophisticated elegance. The primary bath is a luxurious escape with White Carrara marble floors and walls accented by sleek black glass tile, while the secondary bath features ash-gray porcelain tile floors and classic white subway  tile walls. Fixtures by Duravit and Moen add a polished touch.\n\nPerfectly positioned across from Morningside Park in the heart of Harlem, 99 Morningside offers twenty-three thoughtfully designed condominium residences, all enhanced by floor-to-ceiling windows, a refined natural palette, and the benefits of a 15-year  421a tax abatement. Residents enjoy an attended lobby, a high-performance fitness center, bike storage, and a furnished sun deck.\n\nSet on a picturesque tree-lined block in South Harlem, this prime location is moments from express subway access and the vibrant energy of Frederick Douglass Boulevard.\n\nAt the time of lease signing, the tenant is responsible for paying one month's rent to the landlord as the first month's payment, along with a refundable security deposit equal to one month's rent, also payable to the landlord and held as security for performance  of the lease obligations. In addition, a non-refundable $400 lease application fee is payable to the management company. The building also requires a refundable $500 move-in deposit and a separate refundable $500 move-out deposit, both payable to the building.  Additionally, the broker or agent facilitating the lease may charge the tenant up to $20 for the cost of conducting their own background or credit check.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "When you want New York City without the city, you head to Greenwich Village. It is an area about as storybook as Manhattan gets, sporting leafy trees, distinctive buildings, and some uncharacteristic streets. Although gorgeous parks are far from unheard of across all five boroughs, Washington Square Park — with its famous fountain and marble arch — does stand in a class by itself. This iconic destination is a popular meeting place and area for cultural activities, making it a centerpiece the rest of the neighborhood sits around. There’s simply an energy to the park that radiates and shines throughout Greenwich Village. The area’s oldest remaining house is the c. 1799 Isaacs-Hendricks House, which has received some alterations and expansions over time. However, it’s the series of c. 1830s Greek Revival row houses north of Washington Square — boasting stoops and brick facades — that set the Village’s style in brownstone.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Ever wonder why an incalculable number of creative works are set somewhere between 59th and 110th streets, within Central Park West and the Hudson River? All New York City neighborhoods are created equal, but there’s just something about the Upper West Side. Honestly, it’s all in the details: Iconic architecture, city-defining structures like the Dakota, the San Remo, and the El Dorado. Cultural institutions and historical sites of immense international renown line the streets and avenues. Certainly, having two beloved greenspaces — Central Park and Riverside Park — at its horizontal edges doesn’t hurt the reputation either. All of it and more is why so many New Yorkers choose to call the UWS home. It’s also why, at times, this neighborhood can feel as much an attitude or mindset as it does a physical place.",

    "description": "Beyond Central Park, across 110th Street and up to 155th, Upper Manhattan is encompassed by Harlem. Times change, and people come and go, but Harlem remains through it all. Once the site of George Washington’s first victory as U.S. Commander-in-Chief, the area’s status as a real New York City neighborhood began following the Civil War. Rowhouses were constructed starting in 1876 — replacing freestanding homes — to sustain population growth spurred on by public transportation’s arrival. The community expanded exponentially, however, necessitating massive apartment buildings to accommodate. Harlem perhaps has the perception of being a concrete urban jungle, but it is home to Marcus Garvey and Jackie Robinson parks and near several more — including the North Woods/Harlem Meer portions of upper Central Park. Those green spaces add a touch of nature to this famed metropolitan neighborhood, done up in eclectic architectural styles and still beckoning to people from all over.",
