    "description": "This unit is available for move-in immediately and also available unfurnished ($6,000/month).\n\nBe the first to live in this stunning 2BR/2BA duplex apartment at the brand-new Carriage House Lofts, located at 457 West 150th Street between Amsterdam and Convent Avenues.\n\nApartment 1D is bright and airy, featuring expansive windows that reach up to 15-foot ceilings. The vibe is both open and cozy, enhanced by wide-plank antique spruce wood flooring throughout. In fact, the floors were repurposed from wood beams removed from the original structure to create the new courtyard. The unit includes an in-unit washer/dryer and premium kitchen appliances, such as a dishwasher, induction cooktop, circulating hood, built-in oven, and microwave.\n\nEnjoy the convenience of multi-zone central heating and air-conditioning, allowing separate temperature control in different areas of your home to save money (and the planet). The spa-like bathroom is equipped with chrome Grohe fixtures and a deep tub for ultimate relaxation. The European-style windows are thermally and acoustically insulated to manage sunlight and noise.\n\nSecurity is paramount in this 26-unit building, safeguarded by multiple cameras in the entryway and common areas. The ButterflyMX intercom system lets you see and speak with visitors, while elevator access is secured via PIN code or smartphone app, ensuring extra safety on residential floors.\n\nThe landscaped courtyard, open to all residents during daylight hours, offers various seating arrangements perfect for reading, reflecting, or snacking. The rooftop terrace provides lounge seating and a panoramic view of the Sugar Hill district.\n\nAbout the Building:\n\nNestled in the heart of the historic Sugar Hill district of Harlem, a remarkable transformation has taken place at 457 W. 150th Street. A 19th-century carriage house and livery stable, originally built to house horses that raced on the Harlem River Speedway, has been reimagined as a meticulously crafted 26-unit residential rental building. It maintains the original structure\u2019s architectural simplicity and symmetrical design. Originally built in the Neoclassical style in 1920, the building is now ready for its next chapter as a collection of modern studios, 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom units, available now for rent.\n\nThe building\u2019s facade has been beautifully restored to its original splendor, reflecting the architectural grandeur of the Sugar Hill district. Inside, history continues in sustainably repurposed materials: enormous wood beams, salvaged during the creation of the courtyard, have been transformed by a Brooklyn-based wood shop into stunning wide-plank heart pine flooring, featured throughout every unit.\n\nThis unique heritage property is now welcoming tenants to write their own chapters within its warm, inviting walls.",

    "description": "A VIEW OF THE HUDSON RIVER is all yours from this spacious two-bedroom, two bathroom home with fabulous south-facing private terrace. Located near the corner of Broadway and the 1-train, this full-time doorman condominium was built in 2007. The apartment is refreshed with lots of attention to detail. Fresh paint, the Brazilian Cherrywood flooring is back to its original perfection and plenty of 'this and that' make this home ready for a new tenant. \n\nThe layout is practical and current. The primary bedroom has an ensuite bedroom. The guest bathroom is across the hall from the 2nd bedroom. The terrace is off the main living space with an inviting double width entry. The kitchen is separate, yet open. There are black granite counters and stainless Bosch appliances. The oven has a five-burner cooktop. Other features in the apartment include recessed lighting, washer and dryer, south/southwest exposure, and most importantly ample and outfitted closets. \n\nAvailable immediately upon a relatively quick condominium board approval process. This is a rare find with a terrace, in this condition, in this budget. If you are interested, please come to the open house tonight, Monday, from 5:30 - 7pm. Thank you.",

    "description": "Welcome home to a spacious renovated studio with prewar detail ideally located one block from Central Park and around the corner from the 72nd Street Train Station and Trader Joes.\n\nThis home features high ceilings through out with a large window, newly renovated kitchen with a dishwasher, and massive kitchen island ideal for additional prep space, entertaining, or working from home.\n\nSherman Studios features a full time doorman with an elevator and recently updated laundry room.\n\nAccording to New York Times article from May 27th, 1928 that described the construction of the building:\n\nVideo available upon request\n\n\u201cA notable feature of this building is the fact that it will be scientifically sound-proofed, even to the doors. The walls dividing each studio are not only double walls, but the building has been so planned that the studios are separated from each other by intervening chambers, and from the corridors by waiting rooms, pantries, bathrooms etc. In these days of radio, the sound-proof feature should be an interesting feature of all classes of buildings, and the innovation of sound-proofing on this building may be an object lesson worth emulating.\u201d",

    "description": "Apartment 12E at 210 Riverside Drive is a beautifully renovated, top floor, corner three bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom home with views of the River and Park from nearly every window, as well as open city views to the east. Entrance to the residence commences in a white marble and mirrored foyer with an adjacent tiled powder room, that is perfect for guests. The grand and gracious layout benefits from the old-world scale and details that blend seamlessly with modern comforts throughout. The impressive scale is enhanced by over 10'-high ceilings and thirteen oversized windows showcasing dramatic direct and oblique views of the Hudson River, Joan of Arc Park, and Riverside Park from all but two of them, and those windows have unobstructed city views, moon and sunrises! This extraordinary vantage point highlights all the splendor of every season while providing breathtaking daylight no matter the weather and sunsets at days end.\r\n\r\nContemporized prewar details throughout include wide plank quarter-sewn oak floors, custom crown and baseboard moldings, decorative built-ins, beamed ceilings, and Mahogany doors with brushed nickel hardware and glass transoms. Contemporary conveniences include central air conditioning with individual room control, recessed halogen lighting, luxurious baths (one with soaking tub and one with glass shower with dual shower heads, oversized mirrored cabinets with LED lights and towel warmer in the other) with radiant heat floors and double vanities, ample washer/dryer closet, and generous custom closet storage.\r\n\r\n210 Riverside Drive is an elegant, full-service cooperative built in 1909. The 12-story building was designed by Schwartz & Gross, one of the most prolific architectural firms in the city of that era. Amenities include a doorman/elevator operator (7:30 am \u2013 1:30 am) and live-in superintendent, laundry room if needed for larger items/loads, and a bicycle room. Pets are permitted.",

    "description": "This spacious two bedroom apartment, overlooks a quiet garden that belongs to the building and has bit of a Central Park view as well! It has been freshly re-finished by the owners with freshly painted Baker's White walls and gleaming wooden floors. Each bedroom can accommodate a king-sized bed but the primary has an additional alcove and a very large walk-in and walk-around closet! The kitchen has all stainless steel appliances including a built-in microwave, new dishwasher and a large fridge with three feezer drawers as well as a gas range. The kitchen cabinets have been freshly finished in the same wood finishes as the doors and the floors in the rest of the apartment. The bathroom has just been cleaned and re-grouted with a tub, sink, three mirror vanity and under-sink storage. Custom closets and storage spaces abound throughout the apartment from a large built-in in the living area to one in the smaller bedroom and a large utility closet right outside the bathroom.\n\nThe apartment is part of a well-estabilished condominium named \"Towers on the Park\" which include three buildings on the Northwest corner of Central Park. With access to both Morningside and Central Parks and a supermarket in the building, a subway stop on the premisis, two cafes on the Frederick Douglass Circle and restaurants up Frederick Douglass Boulevard, down Columbus and all over Broadway, it is ideally situated. There are three full-time front-desks and a large staff that serve the buildings. Five buses ply the area to bring you up from the Village across to the Costco on the East River, go up and down Central Park West as well as Fifth Avenue and Madison as well as the M4 that goes all the way up Broadway past three Columbia University campusses to the Cloisters (the medieval branch of the Metropolitan Museum). Additional facilities under construction include a swimming pool and ice skating rink in the Northern part of Central Park as well as three Conservatory Gardens a little further East past the Harlem Meer. This part of Central Park is less touristy and has more attractions for those who live in the area.\n\nFor a tour of the apartment and the area, please call or email me.",
